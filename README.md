# SmartHeart
Pingry Independent Research Team Project for analyzing ECG with CNN 

# Signal Processing
- Contains code for performing data preprocessing. ECG data comes from the [George B. Moody PhysioNet CinC 2020 Challenge](https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2020/).

# Models
- This section contains code for training/evaluating models for ECG to ECG translation. Pretrained models are also available.  
- So far we have implementations for CycleGAN (Credits to [Aladdin Persson](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection))
- Many more to come! 

# Training Models from Scratch 
- If you wish to train a model from scratch, run the train.py file
